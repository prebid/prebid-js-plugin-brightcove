## Summary
We take PR review seriously. Please read https://medium.com/@mrjoelkemp/giving-better-code-reviews-16109e0fdd36#.xa8lc4i23 to understand how a PR review should be conducted. Be rational and strict in your review, make sure you understand exactly what the submitter's intent is. Anyone in the community can review a PR, but a Prebid Org member is also required. A Prebid Org member should take ownership of a PR and do the initial review.

For modules and core platform updates, the initial reviewer should request an additional team member to review as a sanity check. Merge should only happen when the PR has 2 `LGTM` from the core team and a documentation PR if required.

## Ticket Coordinator

Each week, Prebid Org assigns one person to keep an eye on incoming issues and PRs. That person should:
- Review issues and PRs at least once per weekday for new items.
- For PRs: assign PRs to individuals on the PR review list. Try to be equitable -- not all PRs are created equally. Use the "Assigned" field and add the "Needs Review" label.
- For Issues: try to address questions and troubleshooting requests on your own, assigning them to others as needed.
- Issues that are questions or troubleshooting requests may be closed if the originator doesn't respond within a week to requests for confirmation or details.
- Issues that are bug reports should be left open and assigned to someone in PR rotation to confirm or deny the bug status.
- It's polite to check with others before assigning them large tasks.
- If possible, check in on older items and see if they can be unstuck.
