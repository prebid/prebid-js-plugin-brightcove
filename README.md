## Plugin Partners

A successful deployment of this plugin includes not only a build of two plugin components but also builds of other components that are  provided in this repository and a companion repository. The “plugin” itself is actually made up of two components:

- the plugin loader
- the main plugin script

When registering the plugin, either on the page or in Brightcove Studio, you should use the URL to the plugin loader.  The loader will automatically know how to load the main plugin script, either from the default location or using a custom path.

The other components partners include:

- **Ad Renderer** - By default this plugin uses one of the following renderers to render the video ad depending on plugin configuration options passed into the plugin at run-time:
  - A customized build of the public MailOnline plugin
        - The default MailOnline rendering plugin is available from: https://github.com/prebid/videojs-mailonline-plugin.git.  
        - You can use the MailOnline plugin as-is or you can create your own build. 
  - Client-side Brightcove IMA plugin  
        - The Brightcove IMA plugin is loaded from https://players.brightcove.net/videojs-ima3/3/videojs.ima3.min.js automatically within Brightcove Prebid plugin.

    Alternatively, you may also partner the Prebid plugin with your own rendering code. Details about how to do this is provided below under [Build and Run a Project Locally](#Run).

 
- **MailOnline CSS** - If you are using the MailOnline rendering plugin, you also need to load the CSS file associated with the MailOnline plugin.  This CSS file is provided in the companion MailOnline repository mentioned above at the following location: `./videojs-mailonline-plugin/bin/bc_vpaid_vast_mo.css`.

- **Prebid Plugin CSS** - This Prebid plugin also supplies an additional CSS file that must be loaded along with this plugin.  This CSS file is located in this repository at: `./prebid-js-plugin-brightcove/src/bc_prebid_vast_vjs.css`.

- **Markers Plugin** - This plugin incorporates code from the Markers plugin: `https://github.com/spchuang/videojs-markers/`.
  - The Markers code is used to help launch ad playback at different points along the timeline.
  - This code has been added directly in this plugin and is found in `./prebid-js-plugin-brightcove/src/MarkersHandler.js`.

## Build Stand-Alone Plugin

To build the project on your local machine, run:

    $ gulp
    or
    $ gulp build

This runs some code quality checks and generates the following files:

-	`./dist/bc_prebid_vast.min.js` - Minified production code of the loader
-	`./dist/bc_prebid_vast.js` - Non-minified production code of the loader
-	`./dist/bc_prebid_vast_plugin.min.js` - Minified production code of the main plugin
-	`./dist/bc_prebid_vast_plugin.js` - Non-minified production code of the main plugin
-	`./dist/styles/bc_prebid_vast_vjs.css` - Non-minified CSS plugin file

## Build and Run a Project Locally

Steps:

1. (optional) Update host file
2. (optional) Modify path to ad renderer - by default, MailOnline
3. Build the plugin
4. Select test page to test with  
    a. Modify path to your prebid plugin build  
    b. (optional) Modify path to prebid plugin CSS file  
    c. (optional) Modify path to MailOnline CSS file  
    d. (optional) Modify path to the prebid.js

### Update Host File (optional step)

To build and run this project locally, if you are planning on using an AppNexus bidder you must first modify your host file to setup an alias for local.prebid.  Otherwise, your "localhost" domain may become blacklisted by AppNexus.

Add the following line to your host file:

```bash
127.0.0.1       local.appnexus
```

### Modify path to MailOnline plugin (optional step)

You can either create your own custom build of the MailOnline plugin or you can replace the MailOnline plugin with your own ad rendering code.

#### Using your own build of MailOnline plugin

If you have either created your own build of the MailOnline plugin or are replacing the MailOnline plugin with your own rendering code, you will need to modify the path that the plugin uses to load the rendering plugin.

- The path to the rendering plugin is defined in `./src/BcPrebidVast.js>loadMolPlugin(callback)`
- The MailOnline plugin is invoked in `./src/VastRenderer.js>playAd(xml)`

#### Using your own rendering code

If you are replacing the MailOnline rendering plugin with your own custom rendering code, you need to change the code where currently an ad renderer is loaded and invoked.

- You MUST explicitly add the `adRenderer` parameter to your cofiguration object with this value: `adRenderer: "custom"`.
- Your renderer must be compatible with the Brightcove Player environment.
- Add your custom function to load your renderer in `./src/BcPrebidVast.js`.
- If you don't want to use the MailOnline plugin, remove the following function, which is used to load the MailOnline plugin: `./src/BcPrebidVast.js>loadMolPlugin(callback)`
  - Make sure that all calls to this function have also been removed from your plugin code.
- If you don't want to use the IMA plugin, remove the following function, which is used to load the IMA plugin: `./src/BcPrebidVast.js>loadImaPlugin(callback)`
  - Make sure that all calls to this function have also been removed from your plugin code.
- Add code to load in your rendering script, if needed.
- Re-write the following function, which currently invokes the MailOnline or IMA plugin to play the ad:  `./src/VastManager.js>play(...)` and `./src/AdListManager.js>playAd(...)`
- Modify the communication code between your renderer and `./src/VastManager.js` and also between your renderer and `./src/AdListManager.js` so that ad playback is synchronized with the playing of the main content in the Brightcove Player.  Currently, the `VastManager` and `AdListManager` are using the following events to manage this synchronization:
  - `vast.adStart`
  - `vast.adError`
  - `vast.adsCancel`
  - `vast.adSkip`
  - `vast.reset`
  - `vast.contentEnd`
  - `adFinished`

### Build the Plugin

Build and run the project locally with:

```bash
gulp dev-server
```

This builds the plugin and starts a web server at `http://local.prebid:8082` serving from the project root.

### Select Test Page

#### Sample Test Pages

There are several test pages provided with the plugin that use the plugin in a variety of ways. These test pages are provided in the repository at: `./tests/e2e/testPages/`

You may select whichever style you want to test. See `http://prebid.org/dev-docs/plugins/brightcove-prebid-plugin/BC-Prebid-Plugin-Options.html` for details on all the options that can be passed to the plugin.

- `prebid-main.html`
    - This page can be used to launch any of the test pages listed below.
    - If you launch the pages directly from this page, an additional query string parameter will be added to the page URL that enables additional browser console logging that may be useful in debugging.
- `prebid-header.html`
    - This test page invokes the Prebid process in the header of the page.
    - The results of Prebid are then rendered by the plugin once the Brightcove Player is loaded.
    - You can configure the Prebid options to either use DFP as the primary ad server or to use no ad server.
- `prebid-body.html`
    - This test page invokes the Prebid process in the body of the page, after the Brightcove Player has been loaded.
    - The results of the Prebid auction are then rendered by plugin once the Brightcove Player is loaded.
    - You can configure the Prebid options to either use DFP as the primary ad server or to use no ad server.
- `prebid-studio-config.html`
    - This page can be used to test using the plugin if you choose to configure the plugin in Brightcove Studio.
    - You will have to replace the player embed code with the embed code for your own player instance.
    - You will need to make sure that all the paths to the plugin, CSS files and prebid.js are configured correctly in the Studio.
    - This page invokes the Prebid process as the Brightcove Player is loading.
    - You can configure the Prebid options to either use DFP as the primary ad server or to use no ad server in the options that are specified in the Studio.

#### Test Page Modifications

Before testing, you may need to make the following changes to your selected test page:

- Change the path used to load the Prebid plugin to point to your plugin build.
- (optional) Change the path used to load in the Prebid  plugin CSS file to point to your plugin CSS location.
- (optional) Change the path used to load in the CSS file for MailOnline (or your renderer).
- If you want to use your own instance of the Brightcove Player, you need to replace the Brightcove Player embedding code that is on the provided test page with your player code.
- If you are replacing the Brightcove Player embedding code, be sure to add the id attribute to the player and set it to `test_player`.  If you have changed the id elsewhere in your code, the id of the player must match the player id that you are passing to `doPrebid()` in the plugin.

As an example, to run the prebid-body.html test page, go to:

+ `http://local.prebid:8082/prebid-body.html`

As you make code changes, the bundles will be rebuilt but you must refresh the page to test the new code.

## Deploy the Plugin

When you are ready to deploy your build of this plugin, you need to make sure that all the paths are set up correctly.  Depending on how you are integrating the plugin with your player, the paths can be defined:
- on the player page or in scripts loaded on the page
- in the configuration of the plugin set up in Brightcove Studio

Make sure the following paths are correct:

- plugin path should point to your build of the plugin loader
- path to MailOnline CSS file
- path to plugin CSS file
- path to your build of prebid.js
